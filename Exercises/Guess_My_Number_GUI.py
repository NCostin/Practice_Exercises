"""
The program youâ€™ll create in this chapter is the classic number guessing game. For those who
missed out on it in their childhood, the game goes like this: the computer chooses a random
number between 1 and 100 and the player tries to guess it in as few attempts as possible. Each
time the player enters a guess, the computer tells the player whether the guess is too high,
too low, or right on the money. Once the player guesses the number, the game is over.
